# DATA FRAMES FOLDER
We used this folder to store all the data frames created after extracting transforming and loading the information into a dataframe. 
These could be used as reference when reading the analysis without having to open the .ipyinb and looking for a specific dataframe.
Category and subcategory data frames where created from extracting unique values in data frame and creating primary keys for both dataframes,
serves as a catalog of cateogries and sub categories for using only an id instead of the whole cateogory string. 
Contacts dataFrame was created from extracting and reorganizing the contacts.xlsx file.
